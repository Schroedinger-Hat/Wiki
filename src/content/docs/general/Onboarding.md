The entry process for a new volunteer is very important and serves to integrate them into Schrödinger Hat.

Usually, new volunteers come from call for volunteers and the process to follow starting from a request is as follows:

- the person who wants to become a volunteer sends a request, which can be made via email or verbally with one of the associates
- a call or chat is scheduled to understand if there's mutual understanding and possibility of collaboration
  - initially make a brief introduction of SH
  - explain what our working method is: discord, task planning, time to dedicate, etc.
    - maybe also doing a screen share showing the board
  - have the volunteer introduce themselves
  - at this point understand if there's a way to integrate them into some task on the board and present the task/problem; go from memory without spending too much time to avoid losing the person's attention. If nothing comes to mind at the moment, postpone task assignment, but still give examples.
  - ask if they have questions
  - if the discussion went well and the person is still interested, ask if they want to receive email communications about activities (e.g., invitations to refinements or other), ask for their Discord handle to add the volunteers role (give a brief intro on what they'll find in the channel)
- If the conversation went well, do welcome in volunteers
- if task is already assigned, do follow-up when necessary based on the time they indicated they had available (30min a week I'd say do follow-up every 2 weeks approximately)
