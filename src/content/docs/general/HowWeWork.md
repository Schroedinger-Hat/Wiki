## Refinements | Weekly Meetings

Refinements are 30-minute meetings where we discuss the status of ongoing projects, analyze new ideas, and define priorities.

***Who?***
Every volunteer can participate, there are no attendance obligations or intervention requirements.

***What?***
In the days leading up to the refinement, each volunteer can add a discussion topic to establish a shared agenda. If no topics are proposed, we proceed with a first round of blocker verification, checking the development status of the [main project](#Main-Project-8020) and ongoing projects, discussing any problems or difficulties encountered, updates on ongoing projects, discussing new ideas and priorities, and assigning any tasks.

***When?***
They usually take place on Wednesdays from 18:01 to 18:29, but can be moved to other days of the week if necessary.

***Where?***
They take place on [Discord](https://discord.schroedinger-hat.org) in the `#volunteers` room. If you don't see the room, send a message to `@founders` in the public `#general` channel or privately to one of the founders, or send an email to `hello@schroedinger-hat.org`.

***Why?***
To keep track of ongoing projects, ideas, and priorities, to avoid wasting time we don't have, and to ensure all volunteers are updated on the current situation.

## Main Project | 80/20

Every quarter, a main project is chosen that becomes the association's focus for the next three months.

## Avoid Single Points of Failure

Every project with only one maintainer must have a second (or even a third) as backup.  
If one is not found, the project is suspended for at least 30 days.

## Onboarding Documentation for Every Project

Every project, technical or not, must have introductory documentation based on the 5W's:
- Who: who are the contacts
- What: what the project does
- When: when we meet
- Where: where the documentation is located
- Why: why the project exists
(this is more of an example outline, you can modify it as needed).
This documentation must be written so that it can be read by anyone, even by those who have never heard of the project.

## Trello as Project Management Tool

All projects relevant to the association must be tracked on Trello. Other projects can be managed through GitHub issues or other tools, but they must still be documented.

## Fair Load on Members

Each person can be assigned to a maximum of **2 important projects** simultaneously. Importance is defined during analysis or subsequent refinements.

## Specific Metrics for Each Project

Every project must have ad-hoc metrics to monitor effectiveness, progress, and impact. These metrics must be defined during analysis or subsequent refinements and must be monitored.

## Multi-format Communication Material

It's essential to have communication material in different formats to reach a wider audience. For this reason, it's fundamental to keep social channels and the website updated, and create content in different formats (texts, videos, graphics) to explain the projects and activities of the association:
- what Schr√∂dinger Hat is
- why contributing is useful
- what a contributor can expect
