## General Overview
Trello is our main tool for project management. Here are organized all the **operational project boards**, each containing tasks related to a specific project.

### Operational Boards
We have numerous boards dedicated to operational projects, such as: [**SH Local Group**](https://trello.com/b/o3qQISuu/sh-local-groups) or [**Association**](https://trello.com/b/jGv9hC6C/association). These boards are used to manage tasks and daily activities of the association. Each board has a specific **objective** that guides the activities.

### "Intake" Board
The **"Intake" board** is the point where anyone can insert ideas or tasks to discuss. As other tasks are completed, ideas from the "Intake" board are moved to operational boards to be developed. This board is fundamental for collecting and evaluating new proposals.

### "Code" Type Projects
Some boards are dedicated to projects with a code project (usually on [GitHub](https://github.com/schroedinger-hat)) with a well-defined **vision** that can bring significant long-term value. Projects like "browser" or "daje" currently don't have a future vision or long-term perspective, so they haven't been included in this category. These projects are managed differently and don't follow the same procedures as operational boards.

## How to Read a Board

### Board

Let's take the "Association" board as an example. It's structured according to the **Kanban** model, with the following lists:
- **To Do**
- **Doing**
- **Feedback**
- **Done**

### "To Do" List
All operational tasks start here. The maximum number of tasks in this list is set to **15** to avoid overload and maintain a manageable workflow.

### "Doing" List
Tasks in progress remain here. Even if they don't have a precise deadline, they are periodically checked to ensure they don't remain **blocked** or inactive for too long.

### "Feedback" List
If a task needs feedback from the community, it's moved to the "Feedback" list. Here it can remain waiting until adequate feedback arrives or requires follow-up.

### "Done" List
Once completed, the task is moved to the "Done" list. It's important to add a final comment describing what was done to maintain a record of completed activities.

### Task Procedure
1. **Reading and Understanding**: When a task is chosen, read the description. If something is unclear, you can leave a comment to ask for clarification.
2. **Assignment**: If the task is understood, you can assign yourself the card, becoming the **owner** of the task.
3. **Move to Doing**: Once assigned, the task is moved from the "To Do" list to "Doing".
4. **Status Update**: During work, it's important to update the task status. If there are problems or you need help, you can leave a comment to ask for support.
5. **Completion**: Once the task is finished, move the card to the "Done" list and add a final comment to describe what was done.
