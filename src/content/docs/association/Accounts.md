If a service allows login with Google, it's possible to login with your own G.Suite and invite who you need.\
If instead an email is required, use the alias `shared.identity@schroedinger-hat.org` (copy to all members `founders@schroedinger-hat.org`).

The password should be shared through the password manager [Bitwarden](../Security/Bitwarden.md)
