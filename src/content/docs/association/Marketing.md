It's possible to use `Schroedinger Hat` without the `APS` part at the end.  

Technically, we can present ourselves to the public with any name and form we want, provided that in the business data we use the same header declared in the "Digital Services" block.  

If in communicating with the public there's the possibility of selling goods or services, the VAT number `IT07355400487` should also always be indicated (see [HeaderDocs.md](/HeaderDocs/)).
* Not needed for: "This is a free event but if you like it you can donate/become a member"
* Needed for: "When purchasing this free ticket you can also purchase a t-shirt"
* Needed for: "The entire website, to be safe and not have to think about which page should have the VAT number and which ones shouldn't"
