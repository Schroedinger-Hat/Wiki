Only the President (Gabriele Puliti) can sign documents that bear the association's letterhead.  
If the signature is by delegation, the person signing must specify, legibly under the signature "Delegated by Gabriele Puliti"

# Delegation

The President can delegate other people to sign provided that:
* They are founding members of the association
* They do not appear, directly or indirectly, on both sides of the document
    * E.g.: The association adopts a cat from a shelter managed by Mattia, Mattia CANNOT be delegated
* The signature does not concern financial operations (approval of budgets, bank account management)

For each signature, a delegation is required. Find the template on our drive.  
The delegation is a writing between two private individuals (president and delegate) and must be kept by the two private individuals. The association does not need to receive or manage the document.

# Letterhead

Any document/PDF sent by the association that makes any proposal of a contractual/financial nature must be sent on letterhead. Find the template in the `templates` folder.  

Emails do not require letterhead.  

Using letterhead is equivalent to speaking on behalf of the association and not us as private individuals.  

Founding members should always be notified of communications sent on letterhead.
